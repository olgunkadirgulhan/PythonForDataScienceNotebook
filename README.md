📊 Data Analysis & Machine Learning Project

This project demonstrates data analysis, visualization, and machine learning workflows using popular Python libraries. It also includes practical examples of Feature Engineering to transform raw data into meaningful features for modeling.

🛠️ Libraries Used
Matplotlib

Matplotlib is a Python library for creating high-quality visualizations. It supports line charts, bar charts, histograms, scatter plots, and more. It is widely used in data analysis, scientific research, and reporting to make insights more interpretable.

NumPy

NumPy (Numerical Python) is an open-source library for scientific computing. It provides fast and efficient multidimensional arrays and supports large-scale numerical operations.

Pandas

Pandas is a powerful library for data manipulation and analysis. It allows working with tabular data through its DataFrame structure. Pandas supports reading data from CSV, Excel, and other file formats, and provides tools for data cleaning, merging, transforming, and grouping.

Scikit-learn

Scikit-learn (commonly known as sklearn) is a Python machine learning library. It offers tools for classification, regression, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and model evaluation. The library includes ready-to-use algorithms, preprocessing utilities, and validation techniques.

🔧 Feature Engineering

This project demonstrates Feature Engineering techniques, showing how to transform raw data into meaningful features for machine learning models. Practical examples are included to illustrate the process.
